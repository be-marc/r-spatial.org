Back in September 2016, leaflet.js went `1.0` (see [Meet Leaflet
1](https://leafletjs.com/2016/09/27/leaflet-1.0-final.html)) with a
massive changelog from `0.7.0` released three years earlier. Meanwhile,
the Leaflet R ecosystem had grown to be very powerful, but also
extremely interwoven and quite complex with significant efforts from Joe
Cheng and the RStudio team on leaflet core, Bhaskar Karambelkar on
[`leaflet.extras`](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras), Tim
Appelhans on [`mapview`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview), and many
other open source contributors. Upgrading Leaflet R to leaflet.js &gt;
1.0 would prove to be a massive undertaking. The `mapedit` team devoted
some RConsortium hours to launching the effort, but the entire effort
proved well beyond the scope of this initial contribution. Fortunately
for the R geospatial community, RStudio very generously provided Barret
Schloerke to complete the daunting remaining tasks.

![screenshot of Barret Schloerke commit](//images/mapedit3-1.png) On May
10, 2018, Barret posted [Leaflet
2.0.0](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/05/10/leaflet-2-0-0/) on the
RStudio blog with not only an upgrade to leaflet.js &gt; 1.0 but also a
full upgrade to all `leaflet.extras` dependencies and very important
infrastructure improvements including a test suite to more easily keep
up with a quicker leaflet.js release cadence.

`mapedit` is entirely dependent on Leaflet, so we postponed activity on
`mapedit` until the new Leaflet R release. We are pleased to announce
that `mapedit` is entirely compatible with the new Leaflet and even more
pleased to get back to work implementing new features and tackling
issues.

In this post, we will highlight the next steps for `mapedit` in order of
priority:

1.  feature attribute editing

2.  geojson precision

3.  multiline string editing

4.  crosstalk integration

5.  shiny async integration.

We cannot stress enough that the success of achieving these depends
greatly on feedback and ideas from the geospatial community, so we
highly encourage participation at
[issues](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues).

Install/Update
--------------

As mentioned a lot has changed recently, so we recommend updating
`leaflet`, `leaflet.extras`, `mapview`, and `mapedit`. The newest `sf`
is not required, but while we are at it, we should probably update it
also.

    install.packages(c("sf", "leaflet", "leaflet.extras", "mapview", "mapedit"))

Feature Attribute Editing
-------------------------

`mapedit` launched with three objectives:

1.  drawing, editing, and deleting features,

2.  selecting and querying of features and map regions,

3.  editing attributes.

So far, `mapedit` has focused on 1 and 2 with only a very quick proof of
concept shown in [mapedit Intro: Ediiting
Attributes](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2017/01/30/mapedit_intro.html#editing-attributes)
building on top of [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) from [Tom
Macwright](https://macwright.org/).

![screenshot of geojson.io integrated in
shiny](/images/mapedit_attribute_edit.gif)

Rather than build on top of geojson.io, we would like to tightly
integrate attribute editing into `mapedit`. We will track progress on
[this issue](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/13) and would
love your participation.

Geojson Precision
-----------------

[Robin Lovelace](http://www.robinlovelace.net/) discovered that at
leaflet zoom level &gt; 17 we lose coordinate precision. Of course, this
is not good enough, so we will prioritize a fix as discussed in
[issue](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/63). Hopefully, this
leaflet.js [pull request](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/5444)
will make this fix fairly straightforward.

Mulitlinestring Editing
-----------------------

Leaflet.js and multilinestrings don't get along as [Tim
Appelhans](https://github.com/tim-salabim) reported in
[issue](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/48#issuecomment-314853140).
For complete support of `sf`, `mapedit` should work with
multilinestring, so we have promoted this to [issue
62](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/62).

Crosstalk Integration
---------------------

Mike Treglia tweeted an interesting use case for `mapedit` with
[`crosstalk`](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/).

<blockquote markdown="1" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

want to make interactive scatterplot and map
(<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GIS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">\#GIS</a>)

- ideally where hovering over point/polygon in map highlights
corresponding one in scatterplot, & vice-versa. Favorite examples w/
code? thinking of leaflet/plotly/crosstalk probably, but open to
alternatives

We welcomed the challenge and responded with this
[example](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/mapedit/blob/master/experiments/select_crosstalk.R)
crosstalking mapedit/leaflet with Plotly and DT.

![screenshot of geojson.io integrated in shiny](/images/mapedit3-2.gif)

While the example mostly works, there is far too high a burden on the
user. We will try to reduce this down to a couple of lines of code.
[Issue 72](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/72) will track
our progress. `mapedit` will remain targeted toward Shiny contexts, so
this effort will focus on [crosstalk with
Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/shiny.html). This plumbing
for crosstalk in `mapedit` should provide a foundation for things like
polygon selection in leaflet without Shiny.

Shiny async
-----------

RStudio added async support in Shiny as described in the post [Shiny
1.1.0: Scaling Shiny with
async](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/06/26/shiny-1-1-0/) and webinar
[Scaling Shiny apps with async
programming](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/scaling-shiny-apps-with-async-programming-june-2018/).
No promises here, but async would be very nice for `mapedit`.

Conclusion and Thanks
---------------------

As we progress towards these goals, we will post on
[r-spatial.org](https://r-spatial.org), and we would love your help..
`mapedit` and many of its dependency packages are funded by the
[RConsortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/). Thanks so much to all
those who have contributed to this fantastic organization. Also, thanks
to all those open source contributors in the R community.
